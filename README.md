# 🛡️Shield Insurance Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my virtual internship and focuses on analyzing a 6-month dataset from a fictional insurance company. The dataset includes 9 different insurance policy types across 5 regions in India. The primary objective was to extract actionable insights into:

- Policy preference trends  
- Regional sales performance  
- Customer behavior by age group and claim settlement patterns
